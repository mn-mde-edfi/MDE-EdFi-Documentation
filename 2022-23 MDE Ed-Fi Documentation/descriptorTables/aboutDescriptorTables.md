# Descriptor Tables
This folder contains a series of CSV tables that list various descriptor values, typically of descriptors that are custom to the Minnesota Ed-Fi implementation. By moving such tables out of the "Mapping Matrix" Excel spreadsheet and into individual files, we accomplish several goals:
1. Allowing full names of descriptors to label a table, instead of being limited by Excel's character limit for tabs.
2. Reducing the size of the Mapping Matrix spreadsheet.
3. Enabling viewers to see when each individual descriptor was last updated
