## Future Developments
- Looking for details on future collections for MDE's Ed-Fi? This documentation will be updated each year. When a new year's worth of documentation is being developed, there will be a newly named "branch" in the repository - branches can be [viewed here](https://github.com/mn-mde-edfi/MDE-EdFi-Documentation/branches). In the meantime, the Sandbox environment does have a "preview release" in the Swagger UI for your exploration.
